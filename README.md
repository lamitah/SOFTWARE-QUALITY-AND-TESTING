- **Crime History**: Access local crime statistics and trends to stay informed about potential risks.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their personal details and keep track of their activities within the app.

## Technologies Used:
- **Backend**: Django (for robust and secure backend operations)
- **AI Integration**: TensorFlow (for analyzing crime scenes and predicting trends)
- **Geospatial Visualization**: Leaflet.js (for mapping and location sharing)
- **Mobile Development**: Flutter (for seamless user experience on mobile devices)

## Installation:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install required dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt` (for Python dependencies)
3. Set up the backend and database by following the instructions in the setup file.

## Testing:
This system has undergone **comprehensive testing**, including:
- **Unit Testing**: Ensures that individual components work as expected.
- **Integration Testing**: Verifies the interaction between system components.
- **System Testing**: Checks the entire system's performance, security, and reliability.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Involves real users to ensure the system meets their needs.
